# AI-driven-WAF

Project Description (Short):
This project focuses on building an intelligent security layer for web applications by analyzing server logs and access patterns. It detects anomalies, unusual behaviors, and potential malicious activity in real time, then responds with automated actions such as alerts or blocking suspicious IPs. By integrating AI/ML, the system continuously learns normal traffic behavior and adapts to evolving attack patterns, offering smarter and more proactive protection than traditional rule-based defenses.

Suggestion one from chatgpt:

That’s a **solid project idea**, Jess 🔥 — you’re basically describing a **mini Web Application Firewall (WAF) + Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** with AI/ML baked in. If you pull this off, it won’t just be “another log parser project” — it’ll look like something recruiters and security engineers actually care about. Let me break it down into layers so you see the path clearly:

---

### 1. **Core Concept**

* Your tool will:

  * **Ingest logs** (web server logs, application logs, access logs).
  * **Detect anomalies or malicious behavior** (SQLi attempts, XSS payloads, brute-force login attempts, unusual request rates).
  * **Take action** → either alert, block the request, or ban the IP temporarily.

This is basically an **AI-driven anomaly detection & response system** for web apps.

---

### 2. **Key Features to Build**

1. **Log Collector**

   * Pull Apache/Nginx logs, app logs, or reverse proxy logs.
   * Parse into structured format (e.g., JSON with IP, endpoint, user-agent, status code, request body).

2. **Rule-based Detection (baseline)**

   * Add static signatures (e.g., `SELECT * FROM`, `<script>`, `../../../etc/passwd`).
   * Track request rates (too many failed logins in X seconds → flag as brute-force).

3. **Anomaly Detection (AI/ML layer)**

   * Train a model on “normal traffic” (IP request frequency, URL paths, request size, status code patterns).
   * Use unsupervised ML (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Autoencoders) to detect “weird” behavior.
   * Example: User normally requests `/home` and `/profile`, but suddenly starts blasting `/admin/login` with payloads.

4. **Response Engine**

   * When suspicious activity is found:

     * **Log-only** (for analysis).
     * **Alert** (send Slack/email alert).
     * **Block** (auto-update firewall rules / `.htaccess` / nginx `deny`).
     * **Kill session** (if integrated with app auth).

---

### 3. **Automation & Self-Learning**

* Feed flagged requests into your ML pipeline → system continuously “learns” what is normal vs abnormal.
* Add feedback loop → security analyst (you) can mark true/false positives.
* Over time, model improves detection accuracy.

---

### 4. **Tech Stack Ideas**

* **Log ingestion**: Python (log parsing), ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) if you want visualization.
* **Detection**: Scikit-learn (Isolation Forest, SVM), PyTorch/TF (Autoencoder).
* **Action**: Python script to update `iptables` / `ufw` / `nginx` rules.
* **Bonus**: Expose as an API or dashboard → “AI-Powered WAF” look.

---

### 5. **How to Showcase It**

* Start small:

  * Rule-based log analyzer that alerts on anomalies.
* Then add ML:

  * Train on real Apache/Nginx logs (use public datasets if you don’t have your own).
* Finally:

  * Demo it in a Dockerized lab → attack your own web app with SQLi/XSS tools (sqlmap, wfuzz, Burp) and show your system catching/blocking.

---

👉 If you finish this, it’s essentially a **research-grade project**. You can pitch it as:

* **AI-based Intrusion Detection/Prevention for Web Applications**
* Looks great on a **resume + GitHub + blog**.
* Recruiters will see *real-world application* → log analysis, anomaly detection, automated defense.

suggestion 2 from chatgpt:

Perfect, Jess 👍 Let’s break this into **levels** so you don’t get overwhelmed, and so you always have a working project at each stage. By the time you hit the last level, you’ll have something that looks like an **AI-driven WAF prototype**.

## 🚀 Level-Wise Project Roadmap

### **Level 1 → Log Analyzer (Foundation)**

**Goal:** Parse and understand logs.

* Collect web server logs (Apache, Nginx, or mock logs).
* Write a Python script to:

  * Extract fields (IP, timestamp, request, status code, user-agent).
  * Summarize traffic (most common IPs, request frequency, top endpoints).
* **Output:** Simple CLI or JSON summary of log activity.

## ✅ *Skills built:* log parsing, regex, data structuring.

### **Level 2 → Rule-Based Attack Detection**

**Goal:** Spot obvious attacks using signatures & thresholds.

* Add detection for:

  * SQLi patterns (`UNION SELECT`, `' OR 1=1`).
  * XSS patterns (`<script>`, `onerror=`).
  * Brute force → too many login failures from one IP.
* Trigger alerts (print to console, save in alert.log, or send an email/Slack notification).

## ✅ *Skills built:* threat signatures, pattern matching, intrusion detection logic.

### **Level 3 → Automated Response**

**Goal:** Don’t just detect — react.

* If suspicious IP detected →

  * Add it to a blocklist file.
  * Auto-update firewall rules (`iptables`, `ufw`) or nginx deny rules.
* Provide an option: **Alert-only mode** vs **Block mode**.

## ✅ *Skills built:* system automation, firewall integration, defensive scripting.

### **Level 4 → Anomaly Detection with ML**

**Goal:** Go beyond static rules — detect “weird” behavior.

* Collect baseline of **normal traffic** (requests per IP, status code distribution, URL usage).
* Train a model (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, or Autoencoder) to learn “normal.”
* Feed new traffic → flag outliers as suspicious.
* Combine with rules → hybrid detection.

## ✅ *Skills built:* ML basics, anomaly detection, using scikit-learn.

### **Level 5 → Smart Dashboard & Continuous Learning**

**Goal:** Make it usable + smarter.

* Build a small dashboard (Flask + Chart.js or Kibana) to visualize:

  * Active attacks detected
  * Blocked IPs
  * Traffic patterns
* Add **feedback loop**: you can mark alerts as False Positive/True Positive → system retrains ML model.
* Optional: Dockerize for easy deployment.

## ✅ *Skills built:* full-stack integration, visualization, AI feedback systems.

## 🎯 Final Outcome

A **multi-layered defense system**:

* Reads logs in real-time.
* Detects attacks via rules & ML.
* Alerts + auto-blocks malicious traffic.
* Learns and adapts over time.

⚡ This way, you can stop at any level and still have a showcase-worthy project:

* **Level 2 = Intrusion Detection**
* **Level 3 = Intrusion Prevention**
* **Level 4–5 = AI-driven WAF**

---

Do you want me to also design a **sample attack-testing plan** (like what attacks you’ll simulate at each level to prove your system works)? That’ll make your future demo 🔥.
Do you want me to draft a **step-by-step roadmap** (like Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 with deliverables) so you can actually start building this instead of just keeping it as an idea?
